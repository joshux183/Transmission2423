The emergence of Denmark and the reign of Harald Bluetooth  
*Else Roesdahl – The Viking World, 652-667 (2008)*

On the great runestone at Jelling, King **H**arald Bluetooth (r. c. 958–87) mentions among his deeds that he had ‘won the whole of Denmark for himself’ (sar uan tanmaurk ala; Moltke 1985: 207). This is sometimes understood today as meaning that he unified the kingdom. However, in concrete terms the inscription tells us that he **a**ctually took power in all of Denmark, which implies that ‘Denmark’ signified a polity that was already recognised. It is **r**arely known exactly when Denmark became unified. For the early Danish chroniclers of the 1100s, this had **e**vidently already happened in the remote age of stories, when their tales began. No historically known king was famed for having unified the **l**and that from the second half of the tenth century clearly appears as one realm under a single monarch.
