on the great runeStone at jelling, king haraLd bluetooth (r. c. 958–87) mentions amOng his deeds that he had ‘won the whole of denmark for himself’ (sar uan tanmaurk ala; moltke 1985: 207). this is sometimes understood today as meaning that he unified the kingdom. however, in Concrete terms the inscription telLs us that he took power in all of denmark, which implies that ‘denmark’ signified a polity that was already recognised. it is not known exactly when denmark became unified. for the early danish chroniclers of the 1100s, this had already happened in the remote age of stories, when their tales began. No historically known king was famed for having unified the cOuntry that from the second half of the tenth century clearLy appears as one realm under a single monarch.
